# FHIR-compliant Data Harmonization Framework for Cohort Studies

CDF2FHIR is a tool that transforms data from cohort studies given on a [standard intermediate format](https://github.com/MyDigiTwinNL/LifelinesCSV2CDF) into FHIR-compliant one in a way that (1) improves reusability by decoupling the transformation pairing rules from both input and output (FHIR) data formats, and (2) ensures a robust transformation process by enabling a test-driven approach for the development of these rules, in addition to other included run-time consistency validation features.
