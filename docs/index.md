# FHIR-compliant Data Harmonization Framework for Cohort Studies

The FHIR Cohort Data Transformer is a TypeScript tool designed to transform cohort-study data into FHIR-compliant data. This tool allows you to specify and test the pairing rules between the cohort-study data and the properties of a given FHIR resource. Once you have defined these rules, you can link them to one or more FHIR-compliant templates.
